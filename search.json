    "section": "Visualizations",
    "text": "Visualizations\nIn order to get a better idea of the abundance of each family in comparison to the overall density for each month I created the following visualization.\n\nCode#Shows the overall amount of frogs over the year compared to the \nFrog_expanded |&gt; \n  na.omit(subfamily) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = eventDate)) + \n  geom_density(aes(fill = subfamily), alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), binwidth = 29, alpha = 0.5) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  scale_fill_viridis_d() + \n  labs(x = \"Date\", y = \"Density\", title = \"Density of Frogs and their Subfamilies over Time\", subtitle = \"2023\", fill = \"Subfamily\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see in above visualization is that frog calls tend to be more abundant October to January which is spring to summer in Australia. Toads most abundant around January-Febuary, late season. In comparison, Hylids are most abundant in December and January, mid to late season. Myobatrachid peaked in October as well as November. Ranid stay pretty consistent throughout the year. However the visuals layering of all the different subfamilies make it difficult to pull out exact measurements. For example, no trends for Microhylidae can be distinguished. The follow visualization splits all the different subfamiles so that they can be better compared against one another rather than the general trend.\n\nCode#Shows the distribution of each subfamily over the course of a year\nFrog_expanded |&gt; \n  na.omit(subfamily) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = eventDate, fill = subfamily)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  facet_wrap(~subfamily) + \n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Subfamilies\", subtitle = \"2023\", x = \"Date\", y = \"Probability Density\", fill = \"Subfamily\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  scale_fill_viridis_d()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this we can tell much more distinctly that Frogs that fall under the Microhylidae family tend to peak in January-Feburary while staying relatively consistent the rest of the year. However while this visual allows you to compare the density of each species relative to the total of each species not the total number of frogs or count. The following visualization addresses this issue.\n\nCode# Function to hide every other label\nevery_other_label &lt;- function(x) {\n      labels &lt;- as.character(x)\n      labels[seq(2, length(labels), 2)] &lt;- \"\"\n      return(labels)}\n\n#Shows the proportion of the different frog families over the course of the year \nFrog_expanded |&gt;\n  na.omit(subfamily) |&gt;\n  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = month.abb, ordered = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = month, , fill = subfamily)) + \n  geom_bar() + \n  facet_wrap(~subfamily) + \n  scale_fill_viridis_d() + \n  scale_x_discrete(labels = every_other_label) + \n  labs(x = \"Month\", y = \"Number of Frogs\", title = \"The Number of Frogs of each Subfamily per Month\", subtitle = \"2023\", fill = \"Subfamily\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough this visual we can clearly see that the Myobatrachid of frogs are the most abundant year round and make up most of the frogs that were documented in Australia in 2023. Hylids are the second most common subfamily, followed by Toad and Microhylidae and lastly Ranid. However because the last 3 categories are all significantly smaller than Hylids and Myobatrachid it is difficult to compare them.\nNevertheless we have answered the research question that Myobatrachids are the most abundant Frog subfamily in Australia and are more relatively abundant during the months of August to November.",
